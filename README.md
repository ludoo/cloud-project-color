# Cloud project highlighter

A simple Chrome extension that optionally sets a per-project user-defined
background color on the Google Cloud Console project switcher. You can install
it in your browser from the [Chrome store page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-project-highlighter/jminhahhcpbacjggeeighhkcabfbpmcb).

The motivation for this extension -- apart from the pleasure I took in
developing it -- is to avoid errors due a project mismatch, by letting users
visually highlight specific projects, or project classes.

A possible future addition will be to implement regex-based highlighting rules.

*Disclaimer: I'm currently working at Google, but this of course is not an officially supported Google product.*
